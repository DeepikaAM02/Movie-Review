<h1>The Best Movie According To Deepika</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Chithha</h3>
<p>The performances, too, are top-notch. There are also a couple of tender moments amidst all the grimness. It is such profound moments that elevate Chithha into something vital in these times.</p>
<h3>Viduthalai</h3>
<p>Viduthalai Part 1 maintains a consistent pace and keeps viewers engaged with moments of high tension.</p>
<h3>Mark Antony</h3>
<p>Mark Antony is not a great film, but it's quite a refreshing entertainer that delivers what it promises.
